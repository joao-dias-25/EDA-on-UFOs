# Project: EDA on UFO sightings


## Overview

The goal of this project is undestand the type of UFO sightings and if there any relation between dates and shapes on diferent locations.

**Trying to find the Truth**

---

## Technical Issues

* The dataset that i found supposedly was clean, but i found some errors on countries displacement
* Tableau was reading wrong the dates because was written in the american way.
* I work on the python and pandas to correct the datetime format.
* while changing graphs types , tableau just change the table and measures without any reason


## Further investigation

* with this dataset one could find patterns in the comments descriptions with regex and try to see if there is more details, like colours or movements of the UFO that people see and try correlate it with the age / background of the person.

## Deliverables



* **A Tableau workbook uploaded to Tableau Public** https://public.tableau.com/profile/joao4789#!/vizhome/UFO_15993077042510/TheUFOstory.

* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualizations and organizing them into a Story as well as your results, obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and a link to your completed Tableau workbook.
